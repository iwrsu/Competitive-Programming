# Competitive Programming Workspace

This repository contains my solutions, templates, and utilities for competitive programming across multiple platforms.  
The focus is on **clean organization, reproducibility, and long-term maintainability** rather than one-off submissions.

## 🧠 Platform Breakdown

### 🟦 Codeforces (`cf/`)
- Organized **by contest**
- Structure:
cf/
└── CF_<contest_id>/
├── A.cpp
├── B.cpp
└── ...

yaml
Copy code
- Mirrors actual contest layout for easy navigation and review.

---

### 🟥 AtCoder (`atcoder/`)
- Organized **by contest type**
- Structure:
atcoder/
├── abc/
│ └── abcXXX/
│ ├── A.cpp
│ ├── B.cpp
│ └── ...
├── arc/
└── agc/

yaml
Copy code
- Designed to scale cleanly as more contests are added.

---

### 🟩 CSES (`cses/`)
- Organized **by official problem categories**
- Structure:
cses/
├── Introductory_Problems/
├── Sorting_and_Searching/
├── Dynamic_Programming/
├── Graph_Algorithms/
└── ...

yaml
Copy code
- Category-based structure matches the CSES problemset layout.

---

### 🟨 CodeChef (`codechef/`)
- Contest-based and practice solutions.
- Folder structure varies depending on contest format.

---

### 🟪 LeetCode POTD (`potd_lc/`)
- LeetCode **Problem of the Day** solutions.
- Typically one file per problem with clear naming.

---

## 🛠 Templates (`templates/`)
- Reusable templates for:
- Fast I/O
- Graphs
- DP
- Number theory
- Intended to reduce boilerplate during contests.

---

## 🔧 Scripts (`scripts/`)
- Helper scripts for:
- Organizing files
- Creating contest folders
- Automating repetitive setup tasks

---

## 🎯 Goals of This Repository

- Maintain a **clean and scalable** CP workspace
- Enable fast revision of past problems
- Keep solutions contest-accurate and readable
- Avoid clutter and ad-hoc file naming

---

## ⚠ Notes

- Filenames generally follow the platform’s problem naming conventions.
- Solutions are written primarily in **C++**.
- This is a personal learning and practice repository, not an editorial collection.

---

## 📌 Future Improvements

- Unified automation scripts for all platforms
- Problem metadata indexing
- Difficulty tagging
- Time/space complexity annotations

---

Happy coding.
